Finally, remember again that because keys no longer returns a list, the traditional coding
pattern for scanning a dictionary by sorted keys won’t work in 3.X. Instead, convert
keys views first with a list call, or use the sorted call on either a keys view or the
dictionary itself, as follows. We saw this in Chapter 8, but it’s important enough to 2.X
programmers making the switch to demonstrate again:
>>> D
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
>>> for k in sorted(D.keys()): print(k, D[k], end=' ')
...
a 1 b 2 c 3
>>> for k in sorted(D): print(k, D[k], end=' ') # "Best practice" key sorting
...
a 1 b 2 c 3
Other Iteration Topics
As mentioned in this chapter’s introduction, there is more coverage of both list comprehensions and iterables in Chapter 20, in conjunction with functions, and again in
Chapter 30 when we study classes. As you’ll see later:
• User-defined functions can be turned into iterable generator functions, with
yield statements.
• List comprehensi
